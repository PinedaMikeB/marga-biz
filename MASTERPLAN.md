## 📝 DECISION LOG

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-05-14 | Use `Talk to Sales` as the public CTA while routing to the AI Product Consultant | Keeps the CTA human and conversion-focused while the consultant introduces herself after the click |
| 2026-04-20 | Add owned-printer maintenance / managed print services as a monitored SEO cluster | Capture companies cutting cost after ending printer rental while keeping printer-rental pages focused on machine-included packages |
| 2026-01-10 | Create INSIGHTS MODULE combining Analytics + SEO | Single dashboard for all data, avoid switching between GA4 and Search Console |
| 2026-01-10 | Expand to 5-module architecture | Better separation of concerns: Insights (view data) vs SEO (automation) vs Sales (leads) |
| 2026-01-08 | Migrate from WordPress to static | Faster load times, lower cost, maintain SEO |
| 2026-01-08 | Use Netlify over Vercel | Free tier sufficient, simpler setup |
| 2026-01-08 | Keep DNS at Hostinger | Email MX records already configured there |
| 2026-01-08 | Delete AAAA record | Was blocking Netlify SSL provisioning |
| 2026-01-10 | Create 3-file documentation system | Prevent context loss between sessions |

## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Documentation Workflow (IMPORTANT)

**During every coding session, Claude must:**

1. **Update HANDOFF.md** — Log current work, blockers, and session notes
2. **Update MASTERPLAN.md** — Mark completed tasks `[x]`, add new tasks, log decisions
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md** — After each deployment, add version entry with:
   - Summary of changes
   - Git commit hash
   - Rollback instructions
   - Files changed

**Starting a new session:**
> Say: "Read HANDOFF.md, MASTERPLAN.md, and CHANGELOG.md from `/Volumes/Wotg Drive Mike/GitHub/marga-biz/` using Desktop Commander"

### Deployment Workflow
1. Make changes locally in `/Volumes/Wotg Drive Mike/GitHub/marga-biz/`
2. Test locally if needed
3. Commit and push to GitHub `main` branch
4. Netlify auto-deploys within 1-2 minutes
5. **Update CHANGELOG.md with new version entry**

### Two Folders (Don't Confuse)
- `marga-biz/` = Production website (deployed)
- `Marga-website/` = Migration toolkit (not deployed)

### Important Scripts
- `add-ga4.js` — Injects GA4 tracking into HTML files
- `scripts/` — Various build/utility scripts
